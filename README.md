# Climate-Change-Analysis
Forecasting Climate Change in India
=
This project aims to forecast the average temperature in India using historical climate data starting from 1800. The data used in this project is obtained from the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST) dataset.

Methodology
=
The project uses the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model for forecasting. SARIMA is a variation of the ARIMA model that is capable of handling seasonality in time series data. 

Results
=
The results of the model are presented in the Jupyter notebook file sarima_test.ipynb. The notebook includes visualizations of the historical temperature data, the predicted temperature data, and the model diagnostics.

Conclusion
=
The SARIMA model was able to capture the seasonal trends in the temperature data and produced accurate predictions. The model can be used as a tool for climate researchers and policymakers to better understand and plan for the effects of climate change in India.

Requirements
=
    Python 3.6 or above
    Pandas
    Matplotlib
    Statsmodels
